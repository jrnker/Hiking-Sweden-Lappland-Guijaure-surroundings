# Hiking-Sweden-Lappland-Guijaure-surroundings

This is a collection of [KML](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language) files for a hiking area in the northern part of Sweden, Lappland, Norrbotten, Arjeplog, Vuoggatjålme, Guijaure / Gujjávrre.
The files have been produced by plotting paths in Google Earth with a map overlay from the Swedish map institute Lantmäteriet, which shows the hiking paths.
The map itself can be viewed here: https://minkarta.lantmateriet.se/?e=539875&n=7384620&z=7&background=1&boundaries=true

Process:
* Run Google Earth locally
* Add the map overlay from [https://git.beroni.us/Lantmateriets-Fjallkarta/Google-Earth.kml](https://git.beroni.us/Lantmateriets-Fjallkarta/Google-Earth.kml)
(Source: [https://github.com/johanberonius/Lantmateriets-Fjallkarta](https://github.com/johanberonius/Lantmateriets-Fjallkarta))

* In *My Places*, *Add new* - *Path*
* Name the path descriptively based on the start and end points of the leg. 
* Draw the leg. Keep the leg a normal hiking distance, normally not longer than 15km / 10 miles.
* Export each leg separately, not as a collection, as these files / legs need to be small to be imported in devices like Garmin GPS'es.

## Helping out
If you download and update or add to the files, then please share this with me.
Getting you hands on good KML files aren't always easy, so stick to *Sharing is caring* :p
Also, stick to KML and not KMZ as plain text is easier to work with.

## Disclaimer

This is not an official hiking trail source, but an private effort without any guarantee of the actual data provided. 

Always check your trail with an official map and **never go hiking without an official map on paper**. They tend to have unlimited battery power and will never fail you.
